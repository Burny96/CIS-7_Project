This program allows the user to both encrypt and decrypt messages by means of a key. This is done using Vigenere cipher which essentially moves the characters in the message by the corresponding character in the key. Once the program is started, the user will be presented with a menu of three choices consisting of 1.Encrypt, 2.Decrypt and 3.Exit. For option 1. the user types in their desired message and then presses enter. After that, the user will be prompted to provide their desired key for that message. After that the encrypted message wil be displayed and the menu will also be displayed. To decrypt a message, the user will select option 2. the follow the same steps except they will put in the encrypted message first. It is important to remember that this program only accepts letters and spaces. If the user provides anything else, an error message will be displayed and the previous request will be displayed again. When the user is finished, simply type 3 and the program will tell you Goodbye! and end the program.
